        <h1>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</h1>
        <p>
            The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in probability and statistics. It states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the variables.
        </p>

        <h2>Meaning of CLT</h2>
        <p>
            The meaning of the Central Limit Theorem is profound in statistical inference. It suggests that, under certain conditions, the distribution of the sample mean of a sufficiently large sample will be approximately normally distributed. This holds true even if the underlying population distribution is not normal. The CLT is a key foundation for many statistical methods and hypothesis testing.
        </p>

        <h2>Proof Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The proof of the Central Limit Theorem involves advanced mathematical concepts such as characteristic functions and moment-generating functions. In essence, the proof demonstrates that as the sample size increases, the shape of the distribution of the sample mean converges to a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the original distribution.

        </p>

        <h2>Simulations and CLT</h2>
        <p>
            Simulations are a powerful tool to illustrate the Central Limit Theorem in action. By repeatedly sampling from different distributions and calculating the sample means, we can observe the convergence to a normal distribution as the sample size grows. This visual representation helps to intuitively grasp the principles of the CLT.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we can see from Homework three where we have M systems are subject to a series of N attacks and on the x-axis, we indicate the attacks and on the Y-axis we
            simulate the accumulation of a “security score” (-1, 1), where the score is -1 if the system is penetrated
            and 1 if the system was successfully “shielded” or protected, the trajectories and the final histogram reflects the LLN behaviour.
        </p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, the Central Limit Theorem plays a crucial role in statistical analysis by providing a bridge between the properties of sample statistics and the normal distribution. Whether through theoretical understanding or practical simulations, the CLT is a cornerstone in statistical theory.
