    <h1>Ito Calculus</h1>

    <div class="theorem">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Itô calculus, named by Kiyosi Itô, is an extension of calculus to stochastic processes such as Brownian motion, with applications in mathematical finance and stochastic differential equations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="theorem">
        <h2>Itô Stochastic Integral</h2>
        <p>
            The central concept is the Itô stochastic integral, a stochastic generalization of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral. In this integral, both integrands and integrators are stochastic processes.
            \[
                Y_t = \int_0^t H_s \, dX_s
            \]
            where \(H\) is a locally square-integrable process adapted to the filtration generated by \(X\), which is a Brownian motion. The integral results in another stochastic process, and its evaluation involves considering a limit of a sequence of random variables.

        <div class="theorem">
            <h3>Integration by Parts</h3>
            <p>
                Integration by parts holds significance in stochastic calculus. The formula for the Itô integral deviates due to the introduction of a quadratic covariation term:
                \[
                    X_t Y_t = X_0 Y_0 + \int_0^t X_s \, dY_s + \int_0^t Y_s \, dX_s + [X, Y]_t
                \]
                where \([X, Y]\) represents the quadratic covariation process.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="theorem">
            <h3>Itô Lemma</h3>
            <p>
                Itô's lemma is a specialized version of the change of variables formula for the Itô integral. If \(f\) is twice continuously differentiable, then
                \[
                    df(X_t) = \sum_{i=1}^n f_i(X_t) \, dX_{i,t} + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^n f_{i,j}(X_t) \, d[X_i, X_j]_t
                \]
                where \([X_i, X_j]\) represents the quadratic covariation.

    <div class="theorem">
        <h2>Application</h2>
        <p>
            In mathematical finance, the Itô stochastic integral is conceptualized as the payoff of a continuous-time trading strategy, with the condition of adaptation ensuring the strategy uses only available information. The process \(Y_t = \int_0^t H \, dX\) is a stochastic process, representing the total value of a trading strategy involving the amount \(H_t\) of stock at time \(t\).
